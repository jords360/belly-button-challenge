# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with building an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. 

I successfully completed all steps in the challenge and was able to create an interactive dashboard that included a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in the individual test subject, create a bubble chart that displays each sample and display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object as a column called "Demographic Info". I was also successful in creating a dropdown menu where the user can select their desired "Test Subject ID No." to display on the graphs.

I cleaned up and removed all errors and bugs that were displayed in the console and everything runs as intended and displays all necessary and desired data.
